Employee Managment System in Python

Name: Rory Stiff

Description


I made a Employee mangment system with python and mysql. The user has
5 options they can choose to add an employee, remove an employee, display employee, display all employees, or exit the application.

What I learned from this project

1. I learned how to intergrate mysql code within my python code so
it could be executed

2. Learned how to interact with mysql data bases and learned how tables are used to hold data

3. Lastly I learned how to connect a mysql database to my code so it would connect and not have any issues
